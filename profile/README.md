# MEITREX - A Gamified and Adaptive Intelligent Tutoring Approach
MEITREX is an intelligent tutoring system developed for software engineering education at universities. This innovative system uses advanced learner analytic techniques to understand each student's individual knowledge, learning behavior, preferences, and motivation factors. To increase student motivation, MEITREX integrates gamified elements that adapt to the individual characteristics of each student. The feedback and support MEITREX offers is designed to be personalized and responsive to the specific needs of each student. Software engineering education is highly practical and thus MEITREX allows students to evaluate their developed source code, assess their UML models, and analyze their group work, all of which contribute to a comprehensive student analysis. 
The overall objective of MEITREX is to increase student motivation and enhance the overall software engineering learning experience. Through its student-tailored approach, this intelligent tutoring system aims to effectively support and engage students to ultimately promote a more successful and enjoyable learning experience.
